"baby_back_ribs":"""For the ribs, place the rib racks into a large, wide, heavy-based saucepan with the celery, onion, chillies, garlic and apple juice. Pour over just enough water to cover the pan contents. Bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is just simmering. Simmer very gently for 1-1½ hours, or until the meat is tender. From time to time, skim off any scum that rises to the surface during cooking.
Meanwhile, for the barbecue sauce, heat the ketchup and muscovado sugar in a frying pan over a medium heat for 2-3 minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved into the ketchup.
Add the Worcestershire sauce, smoked paprikas and vinegar and bring the mixture to the boil. Reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until thickened. Stir in the bourbon, then remove from the heat and set aside. Refrigerate when cool.
For the slaw, whisk together the egg yolks, mustard and vinegar in a large bowl until well combined. Gradually add the oil in a very thin stream, whisking continuously, until the mixture has thickened to a light mayonnaise and all of the oil has been fully incorporated into it.
Drain the celeriac thoroughly and remove any excess moisture using kitchen paper. Stir the celeriac and parsley into the mayonnaise and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Chill in the fridge until needed.
When the ribs are poached, preheat the oven to 240C/220C Fan/Gas 9, or as hot as it will go.

"beignets":"""Begin by activating the yeast. In the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook (or large mixing bowl) attachment add the warm water, yeast and pinch of sugar. Stir and set aside until the yeast has dissolved, about 10 minutes.
To the bowl add the 1/4 cup of sugar, salt, egg, and the evaporated milk. With the mixer on low, add half the flour and mix until just combined. Add the shortening, and then gradually add the remaining flour until the dough forms into a mass. Turn off the mixer and transfer to floured surface. Add more flour, if needed, until you have an even, medium-textured (it should be pretty firm) dough. Add the dough to a large buttered bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest for at least 3 to 4 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator.
Once rested, gently turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle a little more flour on top so you can work with the dough. Gently shape the dough into a 1-inch thick rectangle so it can be cut into squares. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter cut into squares, (you should yield 12 large squares, depending on how thick you rolled the dough).
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F.
Heat about 3 inches of oil in a large, heavy-based pot over medium heat, (you want to make sure there is plenty of room as the beignets will puff up when cooked) to 350 degrees F. Fry the beignets in batches, about 3 minutes per batch. Turn them in the oil while they fry to brown evenly on both sides. Remove from the oil a paper towel lined sheet pan and keep warm in a low oven while you cook the remaining dough.

To serve, give the tomato mixture a final stir, and then spoon generously over the slices of bread. Serve on a big platter as a first course or appetizer.""",
"caesar_salad":"""For the dressing: Place the anchovies into a blender or food processor. Throw in the Dijon mustard, vinegar, Worcestershire, garlic and lemon juice. Pulse the processor or blend on low speed for several seconds. Scrape down the sides.
With the food processor or blender on, drizzle the olive oil into the mixture in a small stream. Scrape down the sides. Add the Parmesan, salt and a generous grind of black pepper. Pulse the whole thing together and mix until thoroughly combined. Refrigerate the dressing for a few hours (it just gets better!) before using it on the salad.
For the croutons: Slice the bread into thick slices and cut them into 1-inch cubes. Throw them onto a baking sheet.
Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan or skillet over low heat.
Crush-but don't chop-the garlic and add them to the oil. Use a spoon to move the garlic around in the pan. After 3 to 5 minutes, turn off the heat and remove the garlic from the pan.
Slowly drizzle the olive oil over the bread cubes. Mix together with your hands, and then sprinkle lightly with salt. Toss and cook in the pan until golden brown and crisp. (Add a little butter for more flavor!)
For the salad: Wash and dry the hearts of romaine lettuce. Leave them whole. Use a vegetable peeler and shave off large, thin slices of Parmesan.
Drizzle about half of the dressing over the top of the hearts. Throw in a good handful of the Parmesan shavings. Give it a good initial toss, just so you can evaluate how much more dressing you need.
Add more dressing and Parmesan to taste. Add the cooled croutons. Toss gently.""",
"cannoli":"""For the shell dough: In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, sugar and salt. Work the butter pieces into the flour with your fingers until the mixture becomes coarse and sandy. Add the egg yolk and the white wine and mix until it becomes a smooth dough. Spread a piece of plastic wrap on a flat surface and place the dough in the center. Wrap the plastic loosely around it and press the dough to fill the gap. Flattening the dough will mean less rolling later. Let it rest in the fridge for a few minutes while you make the filling.
For the filling: In a medium bowl, whisk the ricotta until smooth. Sift in the powdered sugar, cinnamon and allspice. Mix to blend. In a separate bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment), beat the heavy cream until fairly stiff. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the cream into the ricotta mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips. Lightly zest the exterior of the lemon and stir it into the ricotta. Refrigerate for a half hour to an hour.
To roll and fry the shells: In a medium pot with a heavy bottom, heat the canola oil to 360 degrees F. Meanwhile, sift an even layer of flour on a flat surface. Flour a rolling pin. Roll the dough until it is very thin (about 1/8-inch thick). Cut the dough into fourths and work in small batches. Use any glass or small bowl that has a 3-to-4-inch diameter. Cut rounds, tracing around each one to assure the dough has been fully cut. You should have about 24 circles. Wrap each circle around a cannoli mold. Use a little of the egg wash on the edge of each round to seal it shut and to assure it won't slide or fall off the mold before pressing it closed over the mold. Flare the edges out slightly from the mold. Flaring will allow the oil to penetrate each cannoli shell as they fry. Use a pair of tongs to hold the edge of the mold as you submerge and fry the shell in the oil until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oil, and holding the mold in one had with your tongs, gently grip the shell in your other hand with a kitchen towel and carefully slide it off the mold. Set aside to cool. Repeat with all of the circles.
To fill the cannolis: Just before serving, use a pastry bag without a tip to pipe the ricotta into the cannoli molds. Fill the cannoli shells from both ends so the cream runs through the whole shell. Dust with powdered sugar. Powdered sugar gives that little extra sweetness and added texture to the exterior. It also makes me feel like I have a professional bakery touch in my own home. Serve immediately.
If the ricotta has an excess of liquid, drain it over a strainer for at least a half an hour before making the filling. Make and fry the shells and the filling. Don't fill the shells with the cream until you are ready to eat them. Everyone loves a crispy cannoli.""",
"caprese_salad":"""Measure the balsamic vinegar and pour into a saucepan. Bring it to a gentle boil over a low heat. Cook it until the balsamic vinegar has reduced to a nice thick glaze (but still pourable), about 15 minutes. Oh and one other thing, your house will stink. But it's a good kind of stink, it's a vinegary stink. Allow the reduction to cool to room temperature before you serve it.
When you are ready to assemble the salad, cut the tomatoes into thick slices. Arrange them on a platter, alternating them with the mozzarella slices. Tuck the whole basil leaves in between the tomato and cheese slices.
Drizzle on the gorgeous, almost black balsamic reduction. Then drizzle olive oil in a thin stream over the top. Finally, sprinkle on salt and pepper.""",

"cheesecake":"""Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F.
For the crust: Melt the butter, covered in the microwave, in a medium microwave-safe bowl, or a saucepan. Brush a 9-inch springform pan with some of the butter. Stir the remaining butter together with the crumbs, sugar, and salt. Press the crumb mixture over the bottom of the pan, taking care to get the crust evenly into the edges. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool. Wrap the bottom and up the sides of the pan with foil and put in a roasting pan.
For the filling: Beat the cream cheese on medium speed with a hand-held mixer until smooth. Add the granulated sugar and beat just until light and fluffy, scraping the sides of the bowl and beaters as needed. Slowly beat in the sour cream, then eggs, vanilla and both citrus zests; take care not to over whip. Pour into the cooled crust.
Bring a medium saucepan or kettle of water to a boil. Gently place the roasting pan in the oven (don't pull the rack out of the oven). Pour in enough hot water to come about halfway up the side of the springform pan. Bake the cheesecake for about 1 hour and 10 minutes---the outside of the cake will set but the center will still be loose.
For the topping: Stir together the sour cream, confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Spread over the top of the cooked cheesecake and return to the oven for 5 minutes. Turn the oven off, cook the cheesecake in the residual heat in the oven for about 1 hour. This gentle finish minimizes the risk of the dreaded crack in your cheesecake.
Remove cheesecake from the roasting pan to a rack. Run a knife around the edges and cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.
Bring cheesecake to room temperature 30 minutes before serving. Remove the springform ring. Dip a knife in warm water, wipe dry before slicing each piece. Serve with berries, if desired.

"donuts":"""Heat the milk until it is warm but not hot, about 90 degrees. In a large bowl, combine it with the yeast. Stir lightly, and let sit until the mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.
Using an electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, beat the eggs, butter, sugar and salt into the yeast mixture. Add half of the flour (2 cups plus 2 tablespoons), and mix until combined, then mix in the rest of the flour until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Add more flour, about 2 tablespoons at a time, if the dough is too wet. If you’re using an electric mixer, the dough will probably become too thick to beat; when it does, transfer it to a floured surface, and gently knead it until smooth. Grease a large bowl with a little oil. Transfer the dough to the bowl, and cover. Let rise at room temperature until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.
Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface, and roll it to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out the doughnuts with a doughnut cutter, concentric cookie cutters or a drinking glass and a shot glass (the larger one should be about 3 inches in diameter), flouring the cutters as you go. Reserve the doughnut holes. If you’re making filled doughnuts, don’t cut out the middle. Knead any scraps together, being careful not to overwork, and let rest for a few minutes before repeating the process.
Put the doughnuts on two floured baking sheets so that there is plenty of room between each one. Cover with a kitchen towel, and let rise in a warm place until they are slightly puffed up and delicate, about 45 minutes. If your kitchen isn’t warm, heat the oven to 200 at the beginning of this step, then turn off the heat, put the baking sheets in the oven and leave the door ajar.
About 15 minutes before the doughnuts are done rising, put the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, and heat it to 375. Meanwhile, line cooling racks, baking sheets or plates with paper towels.
Carefully add the doughnuts to the oil, a few at a time. If they’re too delicate to pick up with your fingers (they may be this way only if you rose them in the oven), use a metal spatula to pick them up and slide them into the oil. It’s O.K. if they deflate a bit; they’ll puff back up as they fry. When the bottoms are deep golden, after 45 seconds to a minute, use a slotted spoon to flip; cook until they’re deep golden all over. Doughnut holes cook faster. Transfer the doughnuts to the prepared plates or racks, and repeat with the rest of the dough, adjusting the heat as needed to keep the oil at 375. Glaze or fill as follows, and serve as soon as possible.""",

Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and pour in most of the water along with the olive oil. Bring the dough together with your hands or a wooden spoon. As the flour is incorporated, the dough will start to take shape. Add the remaining water if the dough feels tight or hard.

Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and knead for 10 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. Cut off a small piece of the dough and stretch part of it as thinly as you can. If you can see the shadow of your fingers through the dough (the light should shine through the dough like a window pane) without it tearing, it is ready to prove.

Knead the cut piece back into the dough and shape the dough into an even ball. Place in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and allow to prove in a warm place for 1–1½ hours, or until it has doubled in size (the temperature of your kitchen can affect the timing of this).

When the dough has risen, take it out of the bowl and knock the air out. Divide the dough into two equal portions, and shape each portion into a ball. Cover with a damp cloth and allow to prove again for about 15 minutes.

Transfer the chops to a warm plate with tongs. Pour 100ml/3½fl oz cold water into the hot pan. There will be a lot of sizzling, and the water and butter will create an emulsion. Scrape the base of the pan with a wooden spoon to release the caramelised residue, which will give taste and colour to the juice. Continue to heat for a minute or so until the liquid reduces in volume to a rich sauce.

For the sauté potatoes, blanch the diced potatoes in a pan of boiling water for 30 seconds, then drain in a colander and allow the steam to escape for a minute or two. (Of course you can cook the potatoes from raw, but they may brown too quickly as they have a high starch content. By blanching them you are neutralising the starches, giving the potato a better texture and colour.)

On a high heat, in a large frying pan, gently fry the diced potatoes in the oil, season with salt and pepper and cook for 4–5 minutes stirring every minute until golden-brown.

For the persillade, mix together all the ingredients in a small bowl.

Shape the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film and leave to chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

Flour the pasta machine with semolina and divide the pasta into 4 equal pieces. Starting at the lowest (thickest) setting, feed one piece of the dough through the machine, turning the handle with one hand and holding the dough as it comes through the machine with the other. Change the setting on the pasta machine to the next-thickest setting, flour it again and feed the pasta sheet through the machine again, as before.

Repeat this process 3-4 more times, flouring the machine and changing the setting down each time. The pasta should be quite thin, but still easy to handle without tearing. Don't be tempted to skip settings or the dough may tear. Repeat with the other pieces of dough.

Once the pasta sheets have reached the ideal thickness, dust with semolina and set aside.

For the tomato sauce, add the olive oil to a pan and add the garlic and chilli. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the garlic starts to colour a little. Add the tomatoes and warm through in the pan. Season with salt and pepper.

Transfer the drained shallots to a food processor, add the remaining ¼ teaspoons of salt and sugar and all of the crushed chilli flakes and blend until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.

Brush the top of each piece of salmon with a thin layer of the wasabi paste. Sprinkle the crumbed shallot and chilli mixture evenly onto a plate. Turn the salmon pieces over and press each of them into the mixture to coat. Set aside.

For the pickled cucumber, place the grated cucumber into a bowl, add the salt and stir well to combine. Set aside for 4-5 minutes.""",
    "scallops":"""Wash the scallops carefully and pat dry with a kitchen towel.

Place the scallops in a mixing bowl and mix with the olive oil, crushed garlic and chopped fresh parsley.

Chill the prepared scallops in the fridge for about half an hour.

When you are ready to cook the scallops, heat a large frying pan until it's extremely hot, and, just before cooking, lower the heat.

Place the prepared scallops in the hot pan and cook for a minute and a half on both sides.

Serve at once with a squeeze of lemon juice.""",
    "seaweed_salad":"""Toss all the salad ingredients together in a bowl.

To make the dressing, grind the sesame seeds in a pestle and mortar. Add the miso paste and mix well. Put in a small bowl and add the remaining dressing ingredients. Whisk well to combine.

Add the dressing to the salad just before serving, and stir to combine. Garnish with the coriander and serve immediately.""",
    "shrimp_and_grits":"""Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until almost crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer bacon to a dish, leaving drippings in the skillet.
Whisk 1/4 cup water, cream, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl.
Stir 4 cups water, butter, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a pot; bring to a boil. Whisk grits into pot, bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook until grits are creamy, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat and stir white Cheddar cheese into grits.
Place shrimp in a large bowl and season with Cajun seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.
Heat skillet with bacon drippings over high heat. Cook shrimp in hot bacon fat in a single layer for 1 minute. Turn shrimp and add jalapeno; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir cream mixture, bacon, green onion, and garlic to shrimp mixture; cook and stir, adding water as necessary to thin the sauce, until shrimp are cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in parsley.
Ladle grits into a bowl and top with shrimp and sauce.""",
    "spaghetti_bolognese":"""Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Add the bacon and cook for 3–4 minutes, until beginning to crisp. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate.

Add the mince to the pan and cook over a high heat until browned and almost beginning to burn. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.

Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in the pan. Add the onion and cook for 4–5 minutes, until beginning to soften. Add the celery, carrots and garlic and cook 5–8 minutes, then season with salt and pepper.

Add the mixed herbs, increase the heat to high, then add the wine. Cook for 3–5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the wine has reduced by half.

Add the tomatoes, mince and bacon. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for at least 30 minutes, preferably 1 hour. Taste the Bolognese and add the sugar, if using, salt and pepper.

Cook the spaghetti according to packet instructions. Drain and top with the Bolognese sauce. Serve in bowls with grated Parmesan.""",
    "spaghetti_carbonara":"""Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until crisp and slightly browned. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.

Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Add the spaghetti and cook for 8–10 minutes, until firm but slightly chewy (al dente).

While the spaghetti is cooking, beat together the eggs, Parmesan and milk using a fork. Season well with salt and pepper.

Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain over a bowl, reserving some of the cooking water.

Place the frying pan back over a medium–low heat. Add the drained spaghetti and egg mixture and stir thoroughly so all the spaghetti is coated in the sauce. Add 1–2 tablespoons of the reserved pasta water to loosen, if necessary. Serve immediately on hot plates with grated Parmesan on top.""",
    "spring_rolls":"""Carefully separate each sheet of spring roll pastry.

Once separated, cover the pile with cling film so as not to let it dry out.

For the marinade, mix together all the marinade ingredients in a shallow dish.

Mix all the remaining ingredients (except the banana and oil) with the marinade. Leave to marinate for at least five minutes, ideally longer.

Cut the banana in half to use as an edible glue stick.

Place some of the filling in the centre of each pastry. Fold the pastry over diagonally and ‘stick’ using the banana. Holding your fingertips over the roll, use your thumbs to roll the pastry slightly to enclose the filling. Fold in the sides and ‘stick’ again. Roll until fully closed and ‘stick’ again.

Heat the vegetable oil in a pan or deep-fat fryer to 170C/340F (Caution: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)

Carefully place each spring roll into the hot oil – you will need to do this in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan. Once browned and cooked through, carefully remove using a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate lined with kitchen roll. Serve hot.

For the lemongrass sweet chilli sauce, mix all of the ingredients well to combine. Serve the chilli sauce with the spring rolls in a small dipping bowl.""",
    "steak":"""Dip the steak in the beaten egg and sprinkle with the pepper to coat.

Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan and fry the steak for four minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking.

Leave the steak to rest for 5 minutes before serving with the salad.""",
    "strawberry_shortcake":"""Slice the strawberries and toss them with 1/2 cup of white sugar. Set aside.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease and flour one 8 inch round cake pan.
In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder, 2 tablespoons white sugar and the salt. With a pastry blender cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center and add the beaten egg and milk. Stir until just combined.
Spread the batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool partially in pan on wire rack.
Slice partially cooled cake in half, making two layers. Place half of the strawberries on one layer and top with the other layer. Top with remaining strawberries and cover with the whipped cream.""",
    "sushi":"""First make your sushi vinegar - you can buy this ready-made, but it is easy to make your own. Warm the vinegar in a pan, then add the sugar and salt and let it dissolve. Leave to cool and you have the wonderful sweet savoury dressing for the rice. Set aside.

Wash the rice three times, then drain and leave to stand for 15 minutes. Bring one litre/1¾ pints of cold water to the boil and add the kombu (if using) and the rice. Simmer with the lid on for ten minutes, then leave to stand without taking the lid off for another 20 minutes.

Tip into a large wooden bowl, sprinkle on the sushi vinegar and cut through into the rice with a slicing motion with a wooden spatula.

Fan to cool, with a wooden paddle (or an old tablemat), for ten minutes. Turn the rice over, fan for two minutes. Repeat this four times and the rice should be at room temperature and just sticky enough.

Use the rice immediately as it is past its best after a few hours.

For the nigiri sushi, cut your chosen fish carefully into strips. Always try to get sushi-grade fish, and always use top-notch fresh fish - some sushi fish has been deliberately frozen to kill any bacteria.

Take the prawns, peel them leaving the tails intact and butterfly them carefully taking the dark strip out from underneath. Impale them on a skewer lengthways to take out the bend.

Place 500ml/18fl oz water in a pan with the sake and bring to the boil. Simmer the prawns until pink - this should take about two minutes. Leave to cool and remove the skewer. You will have straight prawns which will be easy to place on the rice.

Take a ball of rice about the size of a walnut, roll it in your hands to polish the outside, but don’t compress the rice too much.

Place a dot of wasabi on the top. Place a prawn or a fish strip onto this. Press into place with a tapping motion between your thumb and middle finger. Repeat to use up as much of the fish as you wish to turn into nigiri.

For the maki rolls, take a bamboo-rolling mat, cover it liberally with cling film. Take a half sheet of nori seaweed. (The ones made with half a sheet are smaller and have more filling to the rice ratio, and are a better eat.)

Cover with rice all over except for the edge facing you, where you need to leave an empty border of about 2cm/¾in. - this will give you a join. Press the rice down firmly but gently to give you a thin but even coating. Down the middle, line up your strips of filling – choose from salmon, cucumber, avocado and wasabi. Roll the mat away from you, catching the filling into the roll. Firm up with the mat.

Unroll and using a knife with a damp blade cut into bite-sized pieces.

Serve the nigiri and maki rolls with pickled ginger, wasabi and soy sauce.""",
    "tacos":"""To make the chipotle crema, mix the ingredients together with a pinch of salt in a small bowl and set aside.

To make the salsa, mix all the ingredients together with ½ teaspoon of salt in a small bowl, and set aside.

Heat the oil in a large heavy-based pan to 190C (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended).

To make the batter, sift 200g/7oz of the flour, 1 teaspoon of salt and the baking powder into a large bowl. Whisk in the lager until smooth. Tip the remaining100g/3½oz flour into a small bowl and season well with salt and pepper.

In batches, coat the fish in the seasoned flour, shake off the excess, then dip into the batter. Fry each piece for 2–3 minutes, until crisp and golden-brown. Repeat until all the fish is cooked. Drain each batch on kitchen paper to remove any excess oil. Sprinkle lightly with salt.

Warm the tortillas in a dry frying pan, microwave or oven.

Serve the fish immediately in the warm tortillas, with the cabbage, avocado, salsa and sauces on the side""",
    "takoyaki":"""In a large bowl, mix well Dashi, eggs, soy sauce, salt, and flour with a whisk.
Heat a Takoyaki pan with oil to very hot, just until the oil begins to smoke. Use enough oil to coat the pan using a paper towel so that the batter won't stick. Then pour batter to fill the holes of the pan.
Drop octopus pieces in the batter in each hole, and sprinkle chopped green onions and ginger all over the pan.
Cook at medium heat for 1-2 minutes and turn over using a Takoyaki turner (you can use a chopstick too). It can be a little tricky at first, so watch the video to see the technique. Cook another 3-4 minutes, turning constantly.
Place the cooked Takoyaki on a plate and pour Takoyaki sauce and mayo over them (to taste). Finish the dish by sprinkling the Takoyaki with Aonori (green dried seaweed) and Katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes).""",
    "tiramisu":"""In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together with an electric whisk until pale and creamy. Mix the mascarpone into the egg mixture until well combined.

In a separate bowl, whip the double cream until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. With a metal spoon, fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone, egg and sugar mixture.

In another very clean bowl, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Fold lightly into the mascarpone, cream and egg mixture.

Spoon a third of the mascarpone, egg and cream mixture into a large dish of about 23cm x 33cm (9in x 13in).

Mix the espresso and Marsala together in a shallow bowl. Dip half of the biscuits into the espresso and Marsala mixture, then lay them on top of the mascarpone and cream mixture in the dish. (Repeat the soaking and layering individually as you go or the biscuits will become too soggy to handle.)

Spoon over the next third of the mascarpone and cream mixture, followed by another layer of biscuits. Spoon over the final layer of mascarpone and cream. Cover and chill in the fridge for 24 hours.

Dust with cocoa powder before serving.""",
    "tuna_tartare":"""Remove and discard any dark parts from the bloodline of the tuna. Finely dice the remaining tuna and place in a large bowl. Stand the bowl on ice to keep chilled.

Add the spring onions, chilli and ginger to the tuna and mix well.

In a separate bowl mix together the honey, soy sauce, lime juice, sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds.

Toast the slices of ciabatta on a griddle pan.

To serve, press the tuna tartare into a 7cm/3in chef’s ring on each serving plate. Carefully remove the ring, arrange the toast and lime wedges around the tartare.""",
    "waffles":"""Heat the waffle iron according to instructions (some need to be lightly oiled before you start).

Pour the milk into a large measuring jug add the egg yolks, oil and vanilla and beat together. Combine the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Pour the jug of wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ones, and whisk together, making sure there are no lumps.

Put the egg whites into a clean bowl and whisk to stiff peaks. Slowly fold the egg whites into the batter, until a thick, smooth and airy consistency.

Fill one side of your heated waffle iron with 250ml/9fl oz batter, close and cook for 1 minute, then turn the waffle iron over and cook on the other side for 2 minutes. If you’re using an electric waffle iron, you will obviously not be turning it over, so you may need to cook for a minute or so longer. Just follow the instructions that come with the iron in all cases.

Ease the cooked waffle out of the waffle iron. Repeat until all the batter is used up. If you’re not keeping the waffles warm in the low oven (see recipe tip) each waffle should be eaten as soon as it comes out of the iron. Generously pour maple syrup over your waffle, and tumble a few berries alongside if wished."""
